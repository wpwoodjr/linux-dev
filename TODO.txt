> restarts ok when run via Windows
> username wpwoodjr
> tzdata not working
windows files have root owner when container started in windows
docker daemon not working when run via Windows
> Install docker, kubectl, etc separately
> Install-tools called at end of Dockerfile for kpt etc, how to handle if passing on command line?  Why are they installed at end in user context?
X Run apt install at end only
> Create list of installed tools; what to do when running as root?
> $USER may not be avail in install-tools unless using Dockerfile, need to set it if blank in install-tools
> $DOCKER_GID not avail in install-tools unless using Dockerfile.  Create it based on existing group number for /var/run/docker.sock?  Check interaction with chgrp stuff in bashrc.  Why is that needed?
> Where should do update-locale?  In install-tools?
> What should locale be?  C.UTF-8 or en_US.UTF-8? C.UTF-8
> Instead of "work" dir, use name of parent to passed dir?
> Why does echo need -e in wsl (or in script?) but not in Dockerfile?  b/c Dockerfile is running sh, not bash
> add setup.sh for non-docker installs
> add help to install-tools
> run x apps from container
> improve option handling in run.sh
> add devspace and acorn Kubernetes development tools
> add tig git tool
> improve github release url lookup
only run register_installed after successful installation
